abstract: Vision-based emergent communication (EC) aims to learn to communicate through sketches and demystify the evolution of human communication. Ironically, previous works neglect multi-round interaction, which is indispensable in human commu- nication. To fill this gap, we first introduce a novel Interactive Sketch Question Answering (ISQA) task, where two collaborative players are interacting through sketches to answer a question about an image. To accomplish this task, we design a new and efficient interactive EC system, which can achieve an effective balance among three evaluation factors, including the question answering accuracy, drawing complexity and human interpretability. Our experimental results demonstrate that multi-round interactive mechanism facilitates targeted and efficient communication between intelligent agents.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In the proposed interactive sketch question answering (ISQA) task, two collaborative players are interacting to answer a question about an image. This task emphasizes multi-round interaction, which is essential in daily human communication.
